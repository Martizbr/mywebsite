      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>A little about me, I'm adventurous I like to experience new thing sometimes, I don't like change but I can confidently say that it has helped me grow as a better person. I grew up in Arizona but i also live in Cali Long Beach for a few years. Cali was a great place but Arizona is where I have most of my family.I work at PHX6 as a PA (Process Assistant) for Outbound Dock. 
     My hobbies are Play games, sports, cars, and listening to music. I enjoy outdoor activities like hiking and running. I also like to watch anime with my girlfriend even though she just sits on her phone, and cook. 
  How I started my journey with the world of web development, I've always been intrigued with how websites worked and I have been wanting to build my own. I like working with computers and other sorts of technology. I took Correlation 1 course as a learning experience and an opportunity to adventure this world.
    My plan after the course is finished is to become an intern or in hopes become a full-time developer and learn as much as possible.</p>
